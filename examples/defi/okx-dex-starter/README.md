# OKX Dex Starter

OKX Dex Starter is a simple starter template for interacting with the OKX Dex API. It is built as a CLI tool using TypeScript and Node.js.

## Cloning the repo

To clone the repo, run the following command:

```bash
gitpick sendaifun/solana-agent-kit/examples/defi/okx-dex-starter
```

## Note

This starter template makes use of Solana Agent Kit V1, which makes use of private keys instead of the wallet interface V2 uses, because, V2 doesn't integrate with the OKX Dex SDK yet.
