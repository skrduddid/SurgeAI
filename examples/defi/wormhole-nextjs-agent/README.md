# Wormhole NextJS Agent

This is a Next.js application that demonstrates the use of the Solana Agent Kit to create a Wormhole agent for cross-chain operations. The agent provides a chat interface for interacting with Wormhole's cross-chain messaging protocol, allowing users to perform token transfers and CCTP (Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol) operations seamlessly.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: User-friendly chat UI for interacting with the Wormhole agent
- **Cross-Chain Operations**:
  - Token transfers between supported blockchains
  - CCTP transfers for USDC between supported chains
  - Chain information retrieval
- **Real-Time Transaction Tracking**: Visual feedback for transaction status and completion
- **Transaction History**: View details of completed transactions including source and destination transactions
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices with dark mode support
- **Real-Time Logs**: Debug panel showing agent operations in real-time

## Cross-Chain Operations Supported

The agent supports the following operations:

1. **Token Transfers**: Transfer tokens between different blockchains using Wormhole's token bridge
2. **CCTP Transfers**: Transfer USDC between chains using Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol
3. **Chain Information**: Get information about supported chains and their addresses

## UI Components

The application includes custom UI components for displaying different types of operations:

- **Token Transfer UI**: Green-themed interface showing token transfer details
- **CCTP Transfer UI**: Purple-themed interface showing CCTP transfer details
- **Supported Chains UI**: Grid display of supported chains grouped by network

## Getting Started

### Cloning the template

To clone the template, run the following command:

```bash
gitpick sendaifun/solana-agent-kit/examples/defi/wormhole-nextjs-agent
```

Then, set up your environment variables:

1. Copy `.example.env` to `.env.local`
2. Fill in the required API keys and configuration values

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Usage Examples

Here are some example commands you can try with the agent:

- "What chains do you support?"
- "Transfer 0.01 SOL from Solana to Sui"
- "Send 1 USDC from Solana to Base Sepolia using CCTP"
- "What is Wormhole?"

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React framework for the frontend
- **React**: UI library
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Solana Agent Kit**: Framework for building blockchain agents
